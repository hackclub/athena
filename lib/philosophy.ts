Hack Club is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, supporting the largest network of highly technical teen hackers from around the world. Learn more about us here.

Athena is Hack Club's initiative to support girls learning to code.

Working with local youth organizations, high school Hack Club leaders run one-day coding events (a day of service) that help girls and gender minorities write their first lines of code. They might build their first ever website, video game, application and even code a robot arm to draw!

Built for beginners learning to code, girls are supported by experienced Hack Clubbers. By the end of the day, every single participant builds something with code. In 2023, Hack Club girls ran Days of Service 6 cities, and in 2024 they'll increase events to more than 10 cities.
